  <h1>City Fiscal Dashboard</h1>
  <h2>Find your fiscal peers</h2>
  <p>
    How city leaders confront revenue and spending decisions is influenced by the financial, economic
    and political variables at work in their communities. Cities that have similar abilities to adjust
    property or income taxes will have more in common on financial matters than cities that are alike
    in other ways, like population or geography. But knowing which cities share a similar financial
    ecosystem can be difficult.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help city leaders identify their financial “peers” and benchmark their own progress, we’ve used
    the <a href="http://fiscalpolicyspace.greatcities.uic.edu/">Fiscal Policy Space (FPS)</a> framework
    devised by the College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois at Chicago
    to analyze 100 cities across four factors:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Fiscal Base Score</b> indicates a city’s revenue capacity and is based on the average of
      property, sales and income tax collections per capita</li>
      <li><b>Tax Authority Score</b> shows a city’s ability to collect tax revenue per state statute
      and as demonstrated by the type or types of taxes a city collects (property, sales, and income
      tax)</li>
      <li><b>Property Tax Gap</b> is a ratio describing how much a city uses property tax as a source
      of revenue by comparing the maximum property tax revenue state statute allows to the actual
      amount collected</li>
      <li><b>Demand Score</b> rates a city’s demand for local government services and political culture
      based on the average of income, political ideology and public sector unionization</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Using a cluster analysis, we’ve formed four peer groups to facilitate fiscal benchmarking. Use the
    map below to see how your city compares.
